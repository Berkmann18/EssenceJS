# Essence.js
My All-in-One JavaScript library.

The main features are the following:
-	Adding methods to native objects to make their usage easier and more practical
-	Adding Maths (stats/economics) functions
-	Adding PHP/SQL features without using them
-	Page management
-	Cryptology stuff
-	Computer's stuff virtualisation such as processes and machines
-	Processing's java functions.
-	Web IDE development
-	Using Java objects like Stack, Sets ...

Some ideas to add:
-	Having a dynamic real-time table/update (e.g: news feeds)
-	Having more stats functions like: confidence interval, predictions, ...;
-	Adding the 'APIs' (Download bar, loading bar, task progress list)
-	Having the real-time chat feature as well as the console one
-	code highlighting feature for editors.
-	Floating point binary representation/conversion
-	Currency conversion
-	Calendar
-	Password checker
-	History (event history, command history, viewed pages, ...)
-	IP address getter
-	Brute force equation solver
-	Colour.getColourName() (prototype already placed)
-	Algebraic formula to truth table
-	Something like Java's System.in that allows the code to grab the user's input without having to use JS prompt, contentEditable or HTML's input/textarea fields
-	Parser for MIPS, Batch, Java, Python to DHTML/PHP and eventually to MIPS
-	Heap
-	Permutations
-	cookie historic for multi cookie storage !?
-	greyish hover effect for rows/columns headers that would highlight the whole row/column
-	Essence.say("... ?", "quest")/Essence.ask("... ?") corresponding with Sys.in to get the user input
-	Streams which are like Arrays but: Stream(initial_val, formula, data[], next(): /\*push an element into the data using the last value of the data as a parameter/variable of the formula\*/)
-	Object.compareTo() ?
-	Colour.getColourName()
-	$G["global var"] ?
-	console.log/Essence.say styling using %c, "color: ..."
-	Add: select, datetime, datetime-local, time, month, range, search, week, url; to validate()
-	Custom errors ?

To fix/continue:
-	Huffman based data archieving (creating archive objects that takes datas and keep a dictionnary with the terms and binary versions)
-	Path finding using A*\IDA* with Euclidian/Manhattan
-	Cumultative probability
-	Webpage templating
-	Radial gradient generator
-	Connexion features
-	Server.data
-	UnescapeHTML()
-	maxSort()
-	Hours/mins of s2time
-	Array.remove must affect the initial array in order for multiple removal to work
-	Array.getOccurences()
-	Array.revSort() which leaves a few elements unsorted
-	eqSolver
-	box's graphic methods
-	4x4 matrices support for Array.rot(), Array.det() and Array.getAdjoint()
-	5x5+ support for Array.translate()
-	Machine.parse() for base 2
-	msgBox()
-	spreadSort()
-	QueueList and StackList
-	Synthax highlighting on Editor
-	WebAppBuilder
-	getLocalPath's support for when the path is a few folders away from the local path
-	fully functionnal NoSQL/NoPHP server

##About the future of Essence.js
1.	Once this library is heading toward a state where having everything in one single script will no longer be good for readability and maintenance causing it to be splitted into several files (modules) which would make it less portable and slower in some cases but it will be way more organised, more readable and more maintanable.
2.	The usage of plugins (yes, you could make your own ones and share it so that anyone could use Essence.js with your additions :))
3.	There might be some other upcoming changes after I learn more frameworks and libraries and grab more and more ideas by then as well as better ways to do stuff.

###Note:
-	EssenceJS 1.0 will be the ES4-5 All-In-One version
-	EssenceJS 1.1 will be the ES5 framework (ES4-like module based)
-	EssenceJS 1.2 will be the ES5-6 framework
