##About the future of EssenceJS
1.	The usage of plugins (yes, you could make your own ones and share it so that anyone could use Essence.js with your additions :))
2.	There might be some other upcoming changes after I learn more frameworks and libraries and grab more and more ideas by then as well as better ways to do stuff.

###Note:
-	EssenceJS 1.0 will be the ES4-5 All-In-One version
-	EssenceJS 1.1 will be the ES5 framework (ES4-like module based)
-	EssenceJS 1.2 will be the ES5-6 framework
